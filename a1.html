<p>Pluto (minor-planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit
of Neptune. It is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object to directly orbit the Sun. It is the largest
known trans-Neptunian object by volume by a small margin, but is less massive than Eris.</p>
<p>Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is made primarily of ice and rock and is much smaller than the inner planets.
Pluto has roughly one-sixth the mass of the Moon and one-third its volume. Originally considered a planet, its
classification was changed when astronomers adopted a new definition of planet.</p>
